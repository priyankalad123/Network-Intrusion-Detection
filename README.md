# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Achieving an impressive 99.76% accuracy with a Random Forest classifier for network intrusion detection is commendable. However, it's crucial to supplement accuracy with metrics like precision, recall, and consider real-world implications of false positives and negatives. Thorough testing on a separate dataset is essential to ensure the model generalizes well. Striking a balance between different types of errors is key, as high accuracy alone may not capture the nuanced performance of the model in practical scenarios.

Machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest classifier, are used in the project for network intrusion detection.
